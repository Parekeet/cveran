##Planning:

What is it?: A redo of project 2, but this time with MEAN! Mint is a website for Mint Thai, a fictional Thai Restaurant in Houston, Texas. Users will be able to browse through the site and place an order for pick up.

How to use: Navigate through different tabs to read about the restaurant. Once users are ready to place an order, they can navigate to the 'Order' tab. Users must be logged in to place an order. Once logged in, users can create, save, view, and edit their orders. Once they've completed making their order, submit it and pick it up!
